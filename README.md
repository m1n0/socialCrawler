# socialCrawler

## Goal:
- Gather user info on social network(s) and do analysis mumbo-jumbo.

## Motivation:
- Learning Python, ML, Data Science in practice, integrating data gathering, preparation, analysis and visualisation in one "real world" system.
- Exposing how much "they" know about us from casual usage of social networks.

## Done so far:
- Crawling Facebook friends list using [Chromote](https://github.com/iiSeymour/chromote) to simulate organic browser behaviour.
- Gathering basic friends data and storing in local storage.

## Next steps:
- Crawl peoples walls and profiles and store interesting data for later analysis.
- Crawl friendslists of friends to expand the database of people.

## Other notes:
- Using Chromote resulted in a [small contribution into the library](https://github.com/iiSeymour/chromote/pull/21).
